Hello there! 👋 My name is Dawid, and I'm a React Native Developer. Currently I'm coding Pstryk App ⚡️ 🚀 I'm mostly working with mobile technologies like React Native ⚛️, Swift🦆, and a little bit of Kotlin or Objective-C📱, but I also work with web apps, especially in the React ecosystem. 💻

You can reach out with to me via twitter(or X if that's how you call it 😅): [@dawidzawadadev](https://twitter.com/dawidzawadadev)
